# Project Description
The idea of my project is to create a simulation of an ecosystem, in which different species (classes of objects) live and compete for resources.
Each object will be associated with numerical values for 5 different traits: size, speed, energy(food) requirements, mutation rate and mating rate. 
The values for the traits sums up to an energy value. The initial energy value is equal for all species. 
During the simulation, the different species will be introduced to the ecosystem and compete for resources. 
The energy value for the objects will be increased or decreased based on how well the object performs in the resource-competition.
If the energy value reaches 0 the object will die (be removed from the ecosystem). 

The resources will be: food, shelter, partner availability. 
There will be food available for all species. Some species can also consume other species. 
Mutations are modelled by slight changes in the trait values for each new generation.
